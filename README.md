# OOPS

Object: the data and functions required to model something in code

Class: a blueprint for making an object

Instance: a specific example of an object

Attribute: a named piece of data stored within an object

Method: a function which performs a task on an object i.e. tells the object what to do

Inheritance: a class is able to use all of the attributes and methods from a superclass

Polymorphism: when a method behaves differently depending on which object it belongs too

Aggregation: when an object contains an instance of another object

Static and class methods belong to a class. But instance methods belong to an object.

An instance method is passed "self". A static method is passed nothing. A class method is passed "cls".

@property decorator can be used only for protected(_attribute_name) or private(__attribute_name) attributes. Throws an error with public attributes.
